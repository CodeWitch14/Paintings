   GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration on software development projects. It allows users to create, manage, and share repositories, which contain files and directories, in a centralized location. GitHub uses the Git version control system, which enables users to track changes and collaborate with others in a flexible and efficient manner. The platform provides features such as issue tracking, project management, and code review, making it a popular choice for open-source and commercial software development projects.
